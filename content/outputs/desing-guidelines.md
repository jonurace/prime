# **Design Guidelines for Enabling Equitable Digital Services**
### The target audience for PRIME projectâ€™s design guidelines are the people designing, managing, or improving any public-facing digital services.
### The design guidelines are grouped into 4 over-arching sections, with further guidelines within each section. Guidelines are accompanied with **resources and examples** guiding how to fulfil these design guidelines. This is envisioned as a working document in which more resources and examples will be added. We welcome comments and suggestions for adding such resources/examples. 
### **Contribute !**
### Help us add more examples and resources. You can contribute by contacting Mehdi Rizvi (s.rizvi@hw.ac.uk)
