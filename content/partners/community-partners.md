The PRIME project is guided by a Community-Based Participatory Research framework, underpinned by the principles of equity, empowerment, agency, inclusion and knowledge-production. As such, PRIME is working closely with a diversity of community-based organisations that work with minoritised ethnic populations throughout the UK.
We have four key community organisation partners who have been involved in the PRIME project since its inception:
