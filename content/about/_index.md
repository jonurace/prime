# About PRIME

The Protecting Minority Ethnic Communities Online (PRIME) project will deliver innovative harm-reduction interventions,
processes and technologies which will transform digital services, especially in the interconnected areas of health,
social housing and energy, and create safer online spaces for the UKâ€™s minoritised ethnic population. PRIME was launched
in April 2022 by a consortium of universities led by Heriot-Watt. The other consortium partners are The Open University,
Cranfield University and the universities of York and Glasgow. It is an interdisciplinary project which brings together
academics from the fields of social science, applied linguistics, computer science and data science. PRIME has been
funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) for a period of three years.
