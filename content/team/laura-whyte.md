Laura completed a PhD in astrophysics at the University of Nottingham in 2004. After a brief stint in adult education, Laura retrained to teach secondary school in 2006. Several enjoyable years of teaching teenagers Maths, Physics, and Astronomy were followed by a move to Chicago to work at the Alder Planetarium as an educator and web-developer for the Zooniverse, the world’s largest and most popular online citizen science project. Laura was eventually promoted to run the Zooniverse team alongside the Adler’s Teen Programs and Hack Day portfolio. She has recently joined Heriot Watt to work on Public Engagement for the SECRIOUS project and to act as Project Manager for the PRIME project.
