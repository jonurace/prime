Dr. Farjana Islam is an experienced researcher with an interest in exploring the dynamics of socio-spatial exclusions and inequalities to manoeuvre strategies for equity and inclusion. She has empirical experience of working with socio-economically disadvantaged and minoritised communities in the UK and in the countries of the Global South. She is a co-convenor of the BSA Race & Ethnicity Study Group and currently her works focus on exploring shapes and forms of health inequalities and housing challenges as perceived by the underserved and marginalised groups in the UK. Previously, her doctoral research explored how the Olympic 2012 legacy-led regeneration was contributing socio-economic exclusions to the three distinct ethnic minority communities (e.g. South Asian-British Bangladeshi, Black African and Black Caribbean) in East London. In addition to her work on PRIME she also works as a Research Fellow at the Wolfson Institute of Population Health at Queen Mary University of London.
