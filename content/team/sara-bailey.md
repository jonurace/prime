Dr Sara Bailey holds a PhD in the Sociology of Human Rights from the University of Essex's Human Rights Centre. She is currently a Research Associate at the Institute of Educational Technology at The Open University. Her present research interests are centred on the ways in which structures of class, 'race', age and gender faciliate or impede access to social rights in an era of rapid technological transformation. Before commencing her PhD, Sara worked at the intersection of human rights and international development for UN agencies and NGOs in the UK, the Middle East and East Africa. Sara has published in the areas of social rights and human rights.
