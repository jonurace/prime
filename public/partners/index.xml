      <description>Our Advisory Group ensures that our work is at the leading edge of research, policy and action. It plays a critical role in ensuring research excellence and relevance, identifying emerging challenges and opportunities, and advising on ways in which the PRIME project can translate knowledge into action. Drawn from across sectors, our Advisory Board puts people with lived experience at the heart of the project and includes representatives of minoritised ethnic community organisations, high-level policy makers, regulators, and academics.</description>
